            <p><span class="text-accent">Theodore Samuel Williams</span> <span class="text-italic">(August 30, 1918 â€“ July 5, 2002)</span> was a nineteen-time All-Star, a two-time recipient of the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player Award, a six-time AL batting champion, and a two-time Triple Crown winner. He played his entire career for the Boston Red Sox.</p>

            <p>He made his Major League debut on April 20, 1939. His final game was September 28, 1960.</p>

            <p> He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1966, in his first year of eligibility. He was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Time Team in 1997 and the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999.
            </p>

            <p>He finished his playing career with a .344 batting average, 521 home runs, and a .482 on-base percentage, the highest of all time. His career batting average is the highest of any MLB player whose career was played primarily in the live-ball era, and ranks tied for 7th all-time (with Billy Hamilton). </p>

            <h2>Military Service</h2>

            <p>Williams served as a Naval Aviator during World War II and the Korean War. Unlike many other major league players, he did not spend all of his war-time playing on service teams.</p>

            <p>Williams interrupted his baseball career in 1943 to serve three years in the US Navy and US Marine Corps during World War II. Williams was returned to active military duty for portions of the 1952 and 1953 seasons to serve as a Marine combat aviator in the Korean War.</p>

            <h2>Personal Life</h2>

            <p>Williams' involvement in the Jimmy Fund helped raise millions in dollars for cancer care and research. In 1991 President George H. W. Bush presented Williams with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award bestowed by the United States government.</p>
